+ Variable names are case senstive.


## Numbers
There are three numeric types in Python:
+ int
+ float
+ complex

Variables of numeric types are created when you assign a value to them:

## String

#### Lists are created using square brackets:

+ Access list items using index
+ Access list items from reverse using negative index
+ Slicing to access multiple list items
+ len() function
+ in operator to check if element exist in a list or not
+ append() function to append the new element in the list
+ insert() function to insert element at a given position in the python list
+ Add or concate two lists using + operator
+ Replace list items using index operator
+ Replace multiple list items using slicing
